# What is this?
The future openSUSE newsletter/comnews repository. So far it is using a cheap trick for serving at https://opensuse.github.io/newscom/ on GiHub infrastruture. We won't be needing the trick anymore after this is set up to serve on openSUSE's infrastructure.

# How can I help in the mean time?
1. Fork this repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/openSUSE/newscom.git`
2. Translate the strings under `_data/*.yaml` as required. Check out `en.yaml` for examples. No need to translate what's above `locale_date`.
3. Submit a Pull Request against this repository.
